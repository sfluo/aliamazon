It replaces a much pricier HP 12C Platinum Calculator, which I'd gotten about five years ago when I needed the more advanced functions. I'd bought two of the HP 12C's, to have one as backup, and they were nothing like the 12Cs of before -- the keys malfunctioned on both of the 12Cs within just 25-50 uses (sticking and more often, not registering at all) and there was no easy fix. I've been tolerating them for the last few years, assuming that was just how calculators were made these days, but finally had enough.I just need basic calculator functions now, and for that, the Casio MS-80B is perfect. The interface is incredibly user friendly, the keys work flawlessly (so far), the display is large and clear, and the solar power is a bonus.I also wanted to clear up several question re: the MS-80B's keypad functions. This model does indeed have both an 'off' key and a delete/backspace key, which prior reviews said this calculator doesn't have. The picture currently displayed on Amazon's official product page (as of this review, 6/21/15) is wrong and shows model MS-80S, which lacks these two functions. It's possible that prior reviewers got the wrong model (?).The MS-80B has both an off key and a delete/backspace key, which sit on the top row of the keypad. The backspace key looks like a right-pointing arrow. I've attached a photo of the MS-80B so you can see for yourself.In sum, this is a great basic calculator, for an amazing price. I did a quick search of the other basic models available on Amazon, and this appears to be the best in terms of value, build, and reviews. I can't speak to its long-term durability, but for this price, I don't think you can go wrong!", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5"}, {"Date": "on June 19, 2015", "Text": "works well", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5"}, {"Date": "on June 16, 2015", "Text": "To be used in the RV.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5"}, {"Date": "on June 12, 2015", "Text": "Easy to read digital display which is what I bought it for.

Really bothersome and frustrating; plowing through to get a simple calculation accomplished. The numbers went screwy after about a month of occasional use, only partially appearing on the screen. But that's not all, they also switch value! Unbelievable, but true. You press nine and it shows 9 on the screen, after you press another number that 9 turns into a 3... i kid you not. Into the trash.

This is a solid calculator with a low profile that will help reduce hand strain. The buttons are hard plastic which I prefer over rubber buttons that some other calculators use. The hard plastic gives a solid feel, so you know when you push a button, it registered.  The display is tilted up toward the user at a slight angle but is not adjustable. However, he viewing angle of the display is good even when the calculator is several feet away.The bottom of the calculator has two rubber feet to prevent the calculator from moving on the desk. The bottom edges are curved which feels comfortable if you are holding the calculator in your hand while using it.I experimented with the currency exchange mode and it works, but I will not use it often. I do like the tax rate feature which will come in handy for calculating sales tax.The calculator does come with some very basic instructions, but this is not a problem since this is a fairly simple calculator to use.The calculator switches from solar power to battery power without any indication. This is good since your data will never be lost. It is easy to change the battery by removing two phillips head screws from the back of the calculator.I will be using this calculator dozens of times a day at the office and feel that it is a great value.
