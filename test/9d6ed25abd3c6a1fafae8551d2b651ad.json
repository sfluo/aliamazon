                "Text": "I just received and used this calculator, and it's a steal. It replaces a much pricier HP 12C Platinum Calculator, which I'd gotten about five years ago when I needed the more advanced functions. I'd bought two of the HP 12C's, to have one as backup, and they were nothing like the 12Cs of before -- the keys malfunctioned on both of the 12Cs within just 25-50 uses (sticking and more often, not registering at all) and there was no easy fix. I've been tolerating them for the last few years, assuming that was just how calculators were made these days, but finally had enough.I just need basic calculator functions now, and for that, the Casio MS-80B is perfect. The interface is incredibly user friendly, the keys work flawlessly (so far), the display is large and clear, and the solar power is a bonus.I also wanted to clear up several question re: the MS-80B's keypad functions. This model does indeed have both an 'off' key and a delete/backspace key, which prior reviews said this calculator doesn't have. The picture currently displayed on Amazon's official product page (as of this review, 6/21/15) is wrong and shows model MS-80S, which lacks these two functions. It's possible that prior reviewers got the wrong model (?).The MS-80B has both an off key and a delete/backspace key, which sit on the top row of the keypad. The backspace key looks like a right-pointing arrow. I've attached a photo of the MS-80B so you can see for yourself.In sum, this is a great basic calculator, for an amazing price. I did a quick search of the other basic models available on Amazon, and this appears to be the best in terms of value, build, and reviews. I can't speak to its long-term durability, but for this price, I don't think you can go wrong!"

If this is indicative of the future performance of this new model the MS-80B, which I have owned for about a week, I am certain that it will be a great product also......and it certainly seems so!  I give both of them 5 plus stars and highly recommend the purchase of the new model.

It just kept putting in the number 9 when trying to add, subtract, times, divide, etc. For example, if I want to multiple 2x2, I would enter 2 then hit the X and then it would put \"29\" in my display. If I did 2+2 it would still but 29 in the display. 3x3 or 3-3 or 3/3 it would put 39 in the display and so on. Spoke to Casio's tech help desk and it was determined unfixable (even after being put on hold a little while as wanted to see if I could reset it somehow). It is now officially junk and the tech help never even heard of this problem...that is never good news. I thought Casio would be a good brand name so I would not have to deal with this type of problem...where are the simple good quality calculators at???"

I used it on my very busy loan officer desk for 17 years, spilled coffee, soda, and ice cream on it and it still worked! After I got the new one I felt curious to see if I could open the calculator case to make the keys work better. The case popped open with 2 screws and a couple of easy catches. Inside was a silicone pad under the keys. I wiped off the underside of the keys and washed the silicone pad and the reassembled calculator works perfect, like new!!! I gave the old calculator to the granddaughters and they love it. I think I paid 7 or 8 bucks for this calculator. That is as much as you might spend for one of those big coffee drinks and this lasts virtually through a working career!! No remorse on this one!!"

I bought Casio MS-80TV almost 7 years ago and it still works great. Few years ago I picked up office max tax calculator from a local store and I always get frustrated while using it .The buttons in office max ones are crappy, poor build quality, and one has to put lot of pressure on buttons to make it work.

It's a Casio, they make perfectly good calculators, but this one is a real dud! The \"feature\" regarding tax insinuates itself with everything else you try to do and you can never get it to clear in entirety. Really bothersome and frustrating; plowing through to get a simple calculation accomplished. The numbers went screwy after about a month of occasional use, only partially appearing on the screen. But that's not all, they also switch value! Unbelievable, but true. You press nine and it shows 9 on the screen, after you press another number that 9 turns into a 3... i kid you not. Into the trash. Definitely not a bargain for ten bucks! Save yourself some trouble."

The buttons are hard plastic which I prefer over rubber buttons that some other calculators use. The hard plastic gives a solid feel, so you know when you push a button, it registered.  The display is tilted up toward the user at a slight angle but is not adjustable. However, he viewing angle of the display is good even when the calculator is several feet away.The bottom of the calculator has two rubber feet to prevent the calculator from moving on the desk. The bottom edges are curved which feels comfortable if you are holding the calculator in your hand while using it.I experimented with the currency exchange mode and it works, but I will not use it often. I do like the tax rate feature which will come in handy for calculating sales tax.The calculator does come with some very basic instructions, but this is not a problem since this is a fairly simple calculator to use.The calculator switches from solar power to battery power without any indication. This is good since your data will never be lost. It is easy to change the battery by removing two phillips head screws from the back of the calculator.I will be using this calculator dozens of times a day at the office and feel that it is a great value. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small desktop calculator.  Very pleased with this purchase!"

But as all good things do come to an eventual end, my calculator did and when I went looking on amazon for a replacement, they sure don't make my few decades old calculator anymore, so I went with this one...and it's perfect for my needs. I guess it was about time for an upgrade as far as desktop calculators go. :) It's solar powered so I love how I don't have to worry about changing out the batteries...and it's fairly easy to turn on. The buttons are big enough...and I like the basic-ness of it."
