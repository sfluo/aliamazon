The physics teacher assigned did a lousy job explaining the ins and outs of the physics examination for the N.Y. State Regents board. This book, however, helped the high school student earn well above average on the results.

I have found it an EXTREMELY valuable starting point for my own quizzes and tests. The  questions seem to be the perfect balance between conceptual and  computational assessments.  I use the books in this series as the ideal  curricular standard for the courses described above.
